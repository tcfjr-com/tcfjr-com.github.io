      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a long-time Dodger fan - I went to my first game at Dodger Stadium&#xA;back in 1965 - I was really happy to see them win game 5 today at&#xA;Yankee Stadium to close-out this year&amp;rsquo;s World Series.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can all agree that that fifth inning defensive display by the Yankees&#xA;was horrible, but their overall defense throughout the series was really&#xA;weak.  It&amp;rsquo;s hard to understand, but their coaching staff has to take the&#xA;brunt of the blame.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
