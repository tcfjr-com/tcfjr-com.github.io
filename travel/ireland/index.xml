      <description>&lt;p&gt;We landed in Dublin around 9:15am local time on Monday, 20 January 2025.  The flights from AUS to PHI
and PHI to DUB were pleasant enough, but the overnight flights from the U.S. to Dublin are kind of a
jet lag boot camp.  You land early in the morning, and are encouraged to sleep during the flight, but
your body clock says it&amp;rsquo;s not really the right time to sleep.  And it&amp;rsquo;s tough enough to sleep sitting
up anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We collected the rental car, and made the drive to Banagher, right on the River Shannon in the Midlands.
The AirBnB we booked was about 2km/1.2miles west of Banagher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at the cottage, the host had left the back door unlocked.  We took a brief tour, and
found a number of issues.  The heater wasn&amp;rsquo;t working in the main bedroom, there were lots of cobwebs
and dead bugs in the inside rooms, and the toilet in the main bedroom had a broken seat making it
functionally unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tried to contact the host, but she wasn&amp;rsquo;t available either in-person or by phone.&lt;/p&gt;
