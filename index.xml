&lt;p&gt;A site of my random ramblings.  I&amp;rsquo;m a semi-retired 45-year veteran of the
engineering software trenches, with stints at the Jet Propulsion Lab,
a small appraisal research firm, and 35 years with MSC Software, one of the
leading providers of computer-aided engineering tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a new 2005 Yamaha FJR1300A motorcycle in August, 2004, and used the handle
tcfjr on the FJR1300 forum. (I lived in a town called Temple City at the time, and one
of the top contributors to the forum used a handle with his city followed by &amp;lsquo;fjr&amp;rsquo; so
I wanted to emulate it.) I still have that bike - 20 years later and now with 140,000 miles,
and it&amp;rsquo;s still running strong.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ireland - Week One - January 20-25, 2025</title>
      <link>/travel/ireland/week-one/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-one---january-20-2025&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#day-one---january-20-2025&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Day One - January 20, 2025
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We landed in Dublin around 9:15am local time on Monday, 20 January 2025. The flights from AUS to PHI and PHI to DUB were pleasant enough, but the overnight flights from the U.S. to Dublin are kind of a jet lag boot camp. You land early in the morning, and are encouraged to sleep during the flight, but your body clock says it’s not really the right time to sleep. And it’s tough enough to sleep sitting up anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We collected the rental car, and made the drive to Banagher, right on the River Shannon in the Midlands. The AirBnB we booked was about 2km/1.2miles west of Banagher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at the cottage, the host had left the back door unlocked. We took a brief tour, and found a number of issues. The heater wasn’t working in the main bedroom, there were lots of cobwebs and dead bugs in the inside rooms, and the toilet in the main bedroom had a broken seat making it functionally unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tried to contact the host, but she wasn’t available either in-person or by phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We soon came to the conclusion that this AirBnB wasn’t going to work for us, and I made the call to find somewhere else for the night. The nearest city with a modern hotal is Birr, about 10 miles south of Banagher, and we booked two nights at the County Arms Hotel - it’s an older building, but the rooms are fully modern, and we settled in nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For late lunch/early dinner, we found a nice little coffee shop/restaurant in downtown Birr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-two---january-21-2025&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#day-two---january-21-2025&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Day Two - January 21, 2025
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a nice breakfast in the hotel restaurant, and enjoyed the view out the window.  We spent most of the day resting up
from the long day yesterday.  In the late afternoon we stopped by the local Tesco to get some supplies, and I went and got
take-out burgers from a local pizza/burger/kebab place downtown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-three---january-22-2025&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#day-three---january-22-2025&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Day Three - January 22, 2025
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carole was finally able to resolve the issue with the original AirBnB booking, so now we needed to find another
AirBnB for the remainder of our trip.  One-bitten/twice-shy, we decided it was necessary to visit the prospective
options to make sure they were what they claimed to be and everything was in good working order.  This kind of
pre-visit isn&amp;rsquo;t really a thing with AirBnB, but we were pleased to find that each host was very willing to
show us their offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carole found two options - one in Blackrock, a neighborhood on the Irish Sea in the south part of Dundalk about
45 minutes north of Dublin, and aother in Kilgraney, about half-way between Carlow and Kilkenny about 2 hours
southwest of Dublin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first drove to Blackrock, and met with a very nice host named Karen.  Her lodging is a 3-bedroom, 1 3/4 bath
detached house about half a mile west of the main business district of the small coastal town.  We knew early
on that this was a great option.  It had a washer and dryer (which only a few AirBnB&amp;rsquo;s in Ireland have), a nicely
appointmented kitchen, an super-fast broadband.  We had a nice tour and chat with the host, and then headed out
to the next option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drive to Carlow was long but scenic, and the first hints of the on-coming storm were beginning to show.  We
stopped for gas at what would be called a truck-stop in the U.S.  It included a McDonald&amp;rsquo;s, so we had an early
dinner there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name of the second AirBnB is Lorum Old Rectory, a beautiful old stone building that had been the local
rectory until the mid-1970&amp;rsquo;s.  Adjacent to the main building was the Stables, which had been actual stables
back in the day.  The interior had been lovingly updated, with a noticeable effort at maintaining the historic
feel of the place.  The Stables were the offering for the AirBnB booking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hostess Rebecca was also quite nice, and we left feeling this was also a very acceptable option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we got back to the hotel in Birr, we had decided to go with the house in Blackrock.  It had the modern
amenities we wanted, and was closer to Dublin.  We had plans to meet with an Immigration Solicitor based
in Dublin, so it would be easier to manage the drive from Dundalk/Blackrock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drive from the Rectory back to the hotel in Birr was challenging.  It was rush hour in Kilkenney, and
the sun had just set, and the only reasonable route took us on curvy R roads almost the entire way.  We
were happy to put a close on the long day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-four---january-23-2025&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#day-four---january-23-2025&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Day Four - January 23, 2025
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a nice, final breakfast at the hotel in Birr, we headed back to Blackrock around 11:00am, trying hard
to avoid Storm Eowyn which was hitting the west coast of the island a few hours later.  We made good time
on the way there, taking a slightly different route to add more motorway time in place of the N and R roads
we had used yesterday.  (In Ireland, M roads are motorways, compable to interstates in the U.S.  N roads are
National roads, roughly equivlant to U.S. highways.  R roads are regional roads, comparabale to state
highways.  L roads are local roads, which can vary between single-track roads with tall hedgerows a foot
from either side of your car, up to near R-road quality.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Dundalk around 2:30pm and stopped by the nearby Tesco for food and supplies.  We arrived at
the AirBnB in Blackrock around 4:30pm, unloaded the car and settled in.  We split a grilled cheese sandwich
for dinner, and met with Danny, the co-host with his wife Karen.  Danny went over some of the minor quirks
of the place, and made sure we knew what to expect from the storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-five---january-24-2025&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#day-five---january-24-2025&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Day Five - January 24, 2025
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storm Eowyn arrived in Blackrock around 1:00am, with winds of 90mph, driving rain, and lots of noise.  The
power went out around 1:45am, which was to be expected.  We slept as well as we could under the conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power came back around 1:15pm, and other than a few loose flower pots from the back garden that had
been blown around there was no noticeable damage.  The winds died down to 45-60mph later in the afternoon
and remained relatively high the rest of the night.  There were wide-spread power outages throughout the
island, but the Blackrock/Dundalk area was not heavily impacted, thankfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chicken Nachos for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-six---january-25-2025&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#day-six---january-25-2025&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Day Six - January 25, 2025
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent most of the day unpacking the rest of our gear and getting things organized.  We made use of the
washer/dryer to clean our traveling closes, and went back to Tesco to grab a few more items.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My sister was going through some old papers left by my father, and came across this article
from the local newspaper.  I was invited by a local group for secretaries and administrative
assistants to give a 30-minute presentation on the use of the World Wide Web.  As was the
norm back then, I suited up for my presentation, but I think I omitted the tie.  My recollection
of the evening is quite positive.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New York Times Puzzles with my sister</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the last few years, my sister and I have been
playing the daily New York Times puzzles.  A few months ago, We started sharing our daily efforts
playing Wordle and Connections - we both also play other NYT puzzle games, but
stuck with the two main games to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a great, low-key way to stay connected.  Often we just share the basic
results, but if either of us has a particularly good or particularly bad day
with our solutions, we&amp;rsquo;ll commiserate.  We both agree the most annoying thing
to happen in Wordle is to have 4 of the five letters correctly placed with either
the first or second guess, and then need 3 or 4 chances to find the final letter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Geography is the mother of strategy.&amp;rdquo; - &lt;em&gt;The Vor Game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Reputation is what other people know about you. Honor is what you know about yourself.” - &lt;em&gt;A Civil Campaign&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ians Secure Shoelace Knot</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a nice pair of low-top Merrell shoes I like to wear for walking and hiking.
From time to time the knot would come undone, which is somewhat annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was getting ready to do my 3 mile walk around the neighborhood, and decided I
wanted to learn a secure but easily tied replacement for the bunny-ears knot I
learned in kindergarten.  The solution was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/secureknot.htm&#34;&gt;Ian&amp;rsquo;s Secure Shoelace Knot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy enough to learn and then to tie, and results in a very secure shoelace
that&amp;rsquo;s still easy to untie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a diagram of Step 6, which shows a view of the completion of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many people believe the idiom for someone getting what they deserve is
&amp;ldquo;just desserts&amp;rdquo;, but in fact it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;just deserts&amp;rdquo;.  It&amp;rsquo;s a now defunct
version of the word &amp;ldquo;deserts&amp;rdquo; meaning &amp;ldquo;that which one deserves&amp;rdquo; that
only survives today in that one idiom.  But is is pronounced just like
&amp;ldquo;desserts&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a long-time Dodger fan - I went to my first game at Dodger Stadium
back in 1965 - I was really happy to see them win game 5 today at
Yankee Stadium to close-out this year&amp;rsquo;s World Series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can all agree that that fifth inning defensive display by the Yankees
was horrible, but their overall defense throughout the series was really
weak.  It&amp;rsquo;s hard to understand, but their coaching staff has to take the
brunt of the blame.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I was a kid, I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed peanut butter and pickle sandwiches.
It&amp;rsquo;s a little weird, I guess.  You take two slices of bread, slab on some
creamy peanut butter on both sides, lay some pickles on and close up the
sandwich.  Then enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use either dill pickles or sweet pickles.  Each has their own flavor,
but either one makes for a fantastic sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elvis famously enjoyed peanut butter and banana sandwiches.  Maybe once I
become famous the world will start to enjoy peanut butter and pickle.&lt;/p&gt;
